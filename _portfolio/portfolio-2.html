title: "MigraineMind: AI-Driven Migraine Prediction"
excerpt: "This study uses Random Forest and SMOTE to predict migraine attacks from an imbalanced dataset. 
SHAP values provide interpretability by identifying key predictors like stress, age, and BMI. 
The model achieves a 95.13% accuracy, offering insights into migraine triggers and enhancing early prediction for preventive care. <br/><img src='/images/500x300.png'>"

This master’s dissertation, in collaboration with Happyr Health, focuses on predicting migraine attacks to support teens through personalized behavioral exercises. 
The project leverages AI to anticipate migraines, aiming to enable early interventions that help teens manage their condition.

The AI methodology centers around the Random Forest algorithm, chosen for its effectiveness in handling small datasets and preventing overfitting. 
The model was trained on data from the Smartphone Headache Diary (SHD), which tracks various migraine triggers. 
Due to the imbalance between migraine and non-migraine cases, the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) was used to generate synthetic data for the minority class, ensuring a balanced dataset for model training.

Random Forest’s ensemble learning approach combines multiple decision trees to enhance prediction accuracy. 
To interpret the model’s results, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values were employed, providing insights into how individual features contribute to predictions. 
The analysis revealed stress, age, and BMI as the most significant predictors of migraine attacks.

The model achieved an impressive accuracy of 95.13% and an AUC score of 0.98, offering strong performance in predicting migraines. 
This AI-driven solution aligns with Happyr Health’s mission by facilitating early prediction and personalized interventions for teens suffering from migraines.
