I am an experienced IT Project Manager with a strong background in leading complex projects in the automotive industry. Over the years, I’ve successfully managed cross-functional teams, delivered innovative IT solutions, and driven operational efficiencies. My passion for technology and problem-solving has recently led me to venture into the exciting world of data science.

While I’m still a newcomer in the data science field, I am dedicated to mastering the skills necessary to become an expert. I am currently building my knowledge in machine learning, data analysis, and predictive modeling, applying these techniques to real-world projects. My goal is to blend my project management experience with advanced data science skills to drive impactful, data-driven solutions.

Outside of my professional life, I love exploring new places through travel, which fuels my curiosity and broadens my perspective. I also enjoy sewing and crochet, which offer me a creative outlet and a way to unwind. I believe that these hobbies, alongside my professional endeavors, keep me balanced and inspired. I’m excited to continue this journey, combining my technical expertise with my passion for learning, and I look forward to the opportunities ahead.
